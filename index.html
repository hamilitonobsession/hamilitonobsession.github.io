      <p>Health Benifits of Bananas.</p>
     <p> Bananas are great sources of protein and are sure put a smile on your face! Bananas are also rich with magnesium and potassium which are key materials for your body to function.They both help you maintain a healthy heart and stable blood pressure.Bananas are made up of of three different types of sugars: glucose, fructose, and sucrose. Glucose and fructose are quickly absorbed into the blood stream and provide an immediate energy boost. Sucrose, on the other hand, is absorbed slowly and therefore keeps blood sugar levels stable so that they never go too high nor do they abruptly drop. This longer-lasting energy supply from bananas is great for increasing stamina and endurance.
